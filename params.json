{"name":"TokyoTime","tagline":"Not just an Arduino powered alarm clock.","body":"\r\n\r\nNot just another Arduino based alarm-clock. But much more than that. It has a Two-Wire interface, serial interface, RTC, temperature sensor and a buzzer.\r\n\r\nThese features make it ideal for all projects where temperature and time are critical like:\r\n\r\n  * Waking up in the morning,\r\n  * Cooking,\r\n  * Brewing,\r\n  * Making yogurt,\r\n  * etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition it can be powered from a CR2032 battery, or from a 5V wall-wart.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on the [BigTime](https://github.com/nseidle/BigTime) project by @nseidle, but the whole board was redesigned from scratch.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/78009186/Photos/2013-01-19%2015.16.09.jpg\">\r\n\r\n## Assembly\r\n\r\nCheckout the assembly guide [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/78009186/Documents/TokyoTime_2.1_assembly.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Bootloader\r\n\r\nThe bootloader needed is the \"Atmega328 on a breadboard\" bootloader available\r\n(with instructions) from the Arduino\r\n[website](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard).\r\n\r\nThe bootloader add-on files for Arduino IDE are located in `firmware/hardware`.\r\nTo install them, simply copy the `firmware/hardware` to the local Arduino\r\nfolder.\r\n\r\nThe TokyoTime doesn't have an ISP header to upload the firmware, so another\r\nboard must be used to burn the bootloader to the chip. A standard Arduino board\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\nThe fuse should be set automatically when burning the bootloader using Arduino IDE.\r\nIf not, the fuse should be set to use the internal 8MHz oscillator and disable\r\nthe brown-out threshold. The fuse can be burnt with avrdude using the following\r\ncommand\r\n\r\n    -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m -U hfuse:w:0xda:m -U efuse:w:0x07:m\r\n\r\n## Firmware\r\n\r\nThe TokyoTime board features a handy serial header that can be used to upload\r\nnew code to the chip (provided it has a bootloader) with a 3.3V FTDI-to-USB converter\r\nsuch as this [one](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873).\r\n\r\nThere are so far three different firmware for the board.\r\n\r\n* **TokyoTime** `firmware/TokyoTime` -- A standard clock with settable alarm\r\n  and temperature reading. \r\n* **Kuishimbo** `firmware/Kuishimbo` -- A controller using a PID loop to\r\n  control the temperature of a toaster oven. There is a blog\r\n  [post](http://robinscheibler.org/hacks/2012/08/21/fixing-an-electric-oven/)\r\n  describing the whole project.  This firmware requires the Arduino PID library\r\n  located in `firmware/libraries`. It can be copied to the local Arduino.\r\n* **TokyoIncubator** `firmware/TokyoIncubator` -- A controller using a PID loop\r\n  to control the temperature of an incubator for bacteria, yoghurt or natto\r\n  culture. This was later spun into a\r\n  [project](https://github.com/BioDesignRealWorld/Fermento) of its\r\n  [own](http://biodesign.cc/2013/12/25/diy-incubator/). This firmware requires the\r\n  Arduino PID library located in `firmware/libraries`. It can be copied to the\r\n  local Arduino.\r\n\r\n## Bill Of Material\r\n\r\nAll the parts can be bought at [Akizuki Denshi](http://www.akizukidenshi.com/)\r\nin Akihabara, Tokyo.
