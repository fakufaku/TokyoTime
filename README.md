## TokyoTime

An arduino based alarm-clock. But much more than that. It has a Two-Wire interface, serial interface, RTC, temperature sensor and a buzzer.

These features make it ideal for all projects where temperature and time are critical like:

  * Waking up in the morning,
  * Cooking,
  * Brewing,
  * Making yogurt,
  * etc.

In addition it can be powered from a CR2032 battery, or from a 5V wall-wart.

This project builds on the [BigTime](https://github.com/nseidle/BigTime) project by @nseidle, but the whole board was redesigned from scratch.

## Assembly

Checkout the assembly guide [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/78009186/Documents/TokyoTime_2.1_assembly.pdf).

## Bootloader

The bootloader needed is the "Atmega328 on a breadboard" bootloader available
(with instructions) from the Arduino
[website](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard).

The TokyoTime doesn't have an ISP header to upload the firmware, so another
board must be used to burn the bootloader to the chip. A standard Arduino board
can be used.

The fuse should be set to use the internal 8MHz oscillator and disable the brown-out threshold. The fuse can be burnt with avrdude
using the following command

    -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m -U hfuse:w:0xda:m -U efuse:w:0x07:m

## Firmware

The TokyoTime board features a handy serial header that can be used to upload
new code to the chip (provided it has a bootloader) with a 3.3V FTDI-to-USB converter
such as this [one](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873).

There are so far two different firmware for the board.

* [Alarm clock](https://raw.github.com/fakufaku/TokyoTime/master/TokyoTime.ino)
  : A standard clock with settable alarm and temperature reading.
* [Oven controller](https://github.com/fakufaku/Kuishimbo) : A controller using
  a PID loop to control the temperature of a toaster oven. There is a blog
  [post](http://robinscheibler.org/hacks/2012/08/21/fixing-an-electric-oven/)
  describing the whole project.
