## TokyoTime

An arduino based alarm-clock. But much more than that. It has a Two-Wire interface, serial interface, RTC, temperature sensor and a buzzer.

These features make it ideal for all projects where temperature and time are critical like:

  * Waking up in the morning,
  * Cooking,
  * Brewing,
  * Making yogurt,
  * etc.

In addition it can be powered from a CR2032 battery, or from a 5V wall-wart.

This project builds on the [BigTime](https://github.com/nseidle/BigTime) project by @nseidle, but the whole board was redesigned from scratch.

### Parts and footprints

All the parts can be bought at [Akizuki Denshi](http://www.akizukidenshi.com/) in Akihabara, Tokyo.

*Warning* I still need to check the footprint for all the parts.
